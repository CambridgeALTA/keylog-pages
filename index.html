                This page features a DEMO of the data collection process used in the project 'Deep Learning for Language
                Assessment', as detailed in the paper <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">"Logging Keystrokes
                    in Writing by English Leaners"</a>. By clicking on the COPY-TEXT TASK button, you will be redirected
                to the copy-text task page utilized in this study. Clicking on the ESSAY-WRITING TASK button will take
                you to an essay task page. This page is a random selection from a set of 10 'just for fun' prompts
                provided by the English Learning platform <a href="https://writeandimprove.com"
                    target="_blank">Write&Improve</a>. The content of those pages is the exact content that the
                participants in this study would be exposed to. The content on these pages is identical to what study
                participants encountered. Your keystrokes will be recorded and stored by your browser while you type in
                the textbox on these pages. Please note that your data is secure and not stored by us. After completing
                your typing, you can download a JSON file containing your keystrokes by clicking the download button
                located at the bottom of the page.
