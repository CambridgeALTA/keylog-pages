  <p class="float-left" id='prompt'>I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest
    universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a
    college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.
    The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then
    stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started
    before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up
    for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me
    to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that
    they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:
    "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?" They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that
    my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to
    sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday
    go to college. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as
    Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I
    couldn't see the value in it.</p>
