  <p class="float-left" id='instructions'><b>TASK 2: TYPE YOUR ANSWER IN THE TEXTBOX PROVIDED STRAIGHT AWAY IN ENGLISH.
      DO NOT use another text editor, and DO NOT copy/paste text from other sources. Genuinely attempt to answer the
      question ON YOUR OWN and to the best of your ability. DO NOT take breaks (unless you need to think), and DO NOT
      use any grammar/spelling checkers or any other English language tools. DO NOT open another tab on your browser. DO
      NOT try to look for answers on the web, and DO NOT use any chatbots to generate the answer for you. If you do, we
      will be able to know, and your submission will be REJECTED. The validity of your submission does not depend on the
      quality of your English. Your answer must be MORE than 150 words. You may use the provided button to count the
      number of words that you have typed at any point. When you finish typing, use the download button to download your
      data. Then, return to the survey page, upload the file, and click next. DO NOT rename the file. Make sure you
      UPLOAD THE CORRECT FILE. If you fail to follow these instructions, your data will not be used, and you will not
      get paid.</b></p>
